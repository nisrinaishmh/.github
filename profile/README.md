  ## About The Project
  
Title : Coral Reef Ecosystem Information System in Indonesia that Utilizes GIS as a Conservation Effort for Monitoring and Preservation
Project : participants of OLIVIA Competition 2024 🏅 
Background and objectives :
🐬⋆｡˚🪼🫧˚｡⋆🌊⋆｡°்⋆꒰ 🐚 ꒱ؘ ࿐ ࿔*:･ﾟ⋆🐟
Rapid population growth has triggered an increase in the need for land as a place to live, which could threaten the availability of land for the terrestrial agricultural sector. In addition, the rampant practice of overfishing has depleted fish stocks in inland waters. These two factors have driven the need for a new paradigm to shift the source of land-based protein (red meat) to the ocean (white meat). However, before optimizing marine food sources, it is necessary to first optimize the habitat of these marine life, namely coral reefs. According to Dr. Bert W. Hoeksema, a researcher at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands, coral reefs are now increasingly threatened with extinction due to both human activities and natural factors.

To address this, the NMIXX team has created a smart system that aims to minimize coral reef damage in the future and ensure the sustainability of marine food sources. CoralGuard is a website-based information system that digitizes the process of educating the public to better understand, protect, and conserve Indonesian coral reefs for the sake of marine life. The website is designed to allow users to find out the location of coral reefs in Indonesia, get in-depth information about coral reefs and the biodiversity that surrounds them, learn about the threats, effects, and impacts of energy on coral reefs and vice versa, get recommendations for underwater tourist destinations, and even have a community to discuss with other users such as fishermen and coral reef experts.

In addition, as a smart system, the website also provides a chatbot called CoralAI that can answer questions about coral reefs in a short time and can also detect image classification of the healthy or bleaching condition of coral reefs.
